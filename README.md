## Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

### PyBank

    Creating a Python script for analyzing financial records. Given sets of data consist of dates and value
    of profit/loss, we need to analyze:
    
    - The total number of months in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
    I will need to display above analysis in both terminal as well as an exported text file in "analysis" 
    folder.

    In my script, I practiced how to create lits to store datasets, and employeed a few function to collect
    the target values.

    
    Detailed usage of each code is included in the comment outs.

### PyPoll

    Creating a Python script for analyzing an election poll data. Given sets of data consist of voter ID, 
    county, and the name of candidate voted, we need to analyze:
    
    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote
    I will need to display above analysis in both terminal as well as an exported text file in "analysis" 
    folder.

    In my script, I practiced how to create a dictionary to store datasets and pair keys with vlaues. I 
    also practiced how to extract these data using For loops.
